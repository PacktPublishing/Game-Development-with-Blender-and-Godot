**Leverage the combined power of Blender and Godot for building a point-and-click adventure game**

## What is this book about?
Game Development with Blender and Godot is a comprehensive introduction for those new to building 3D models and games, allowing you to leverage the abilities of these two technologies to create dynamic, interactive, and engaging games.
This book will start by focusing on what low-poly modeling is, before showing you how to use Blender to create, rig, and animate your models. You will also polish these assets until theyâ€™re game-ready, making it easy for you to import them into Godot and use them effectively and efficiently. Next, you will use the game engine to design scenes, work with light and shadows, and transform your 3D models into interactive, controllable assets.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover what low-poly modeling is and why it matters
* Understand how to use materials, shaders, and textures in your models
* Explore how to render and animate a scene in Blender
* Focus on how to export Blender assets and import them into Godot
* Use 3D low-poly models in Godot to create fun games
* Design a dynamic and easy-to-navigate game world
* Explore how to interact with the game via interfaces
* Understand how to export your game for Windows

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
metallic = saturate(metallic);
transmission = saturate(transmission);
float diffuse_weight = (1.0 - transmission) * (1.0 - metallic);
transmission *= (1.0 - metallic);
float specular_weight = (1.0 - transmission);
clearcoat = max(clearcoat, 0.0);
transmission_roughness = 1.0 - (1.0 - roughness) * (1.0 - transmission_roughness);
specular = max(0.0, specular);
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for game developers who are looking to make the transition from 2D to 3D games. Readers should have a basic understanding of Godot, being able to navigate the UI, understand the inspector panel, create scenes, add scripts to game objects, and more.
