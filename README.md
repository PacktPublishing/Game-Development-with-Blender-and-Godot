# Game Development with Blender and Godot

## Repo Structure
The *Start* and *Finish* folders are partitioned in their relevant chapter folders.

We kept the 3D content in a separate *Blender Models* folder for the sake of preventing duplications. Relevant glTF files have been exported to individual chapters.  

## About the Author
### Kumsal Obuz
Kumsal Obuz is a self-taught veteran web developer with more than 15 years of experience in two different countries, leading teams and projects of various sizes.

After several years of preparation, he started his own game studio, Viroid Games, in August 2020. He then launched a small puzzle-strategy game at the end of 2020 and is currently working on an ambitious farming simulation game.

He also enjoys mentoring, which runs in the family since both of his parents are teachers. In 2019, he founded and still organizes the Godot Toronto group on Discord.

In his spare time, he likes reading history (mostly medieval) and science-fiction.
